This app implements basic todo App and gives developer a chance to demonstrate his skills to: 
-> create a task, 
-> show the created task in the list,
-> check/uncheck them as done/not done
-> edit and delete the items 
-> apply filters on those items
-> create custom hook to generate unique IDs
-> pass data from child to parent using callback
